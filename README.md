Auditorium 2
============

This is a very simple to use program for playing sound files (mp3 and wav).
It is designed for use in the amateur theatre.

Added the Effects buttons which load and clear automatically.

Put all files into a single directory.  Each file should be numbered with
the page number on which it occurs.  Use leading zeros to provide at least
three digits, this is followed by a space a dash and a space.

if two bits of music occur on the same page then use the letters a - z in place
of the space before the hyphen.

Sound effects should have a lower case letter A - Z.  They will be loaded into
the special area at the same time as the associated music and be playable
multiple times, anytime.
